# CSS---My-Site
A mock website with simple HTML coding that has three main div classes for containers, and a social-media button bar at the end of the website. Currently coding alongside Angela Yu's "The Complete 2021 Web Developer Bootcamp" with this section focusing mainly on styling, positioning and much more. I've decided to create the repository on Github instead because of easier accessbility.
